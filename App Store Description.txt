Based on the Java application "Sequence Analysis" this is a SwiftUI rewrite for macOS. Analyses currently provided are ORF, Pattern, File Format, Publish, Composition and pI, as well as a "do it yourself" Genome Information Viewer. Future versions will port over secondary protein structure e.g. Chou-Fasman, sequence alignment, primer design and restriction enzyme digests. This is my first native macOS application written using SwiftUI. It will probably crash from time to time but better to release 'good enough' than wait for it to be 'perfect'.
